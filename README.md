# SQL_Project_data_Layoff_exploration
This SQL project explores layoffs data, analyzing top companies by layoffs, trends over time, and industry and country-wise distributions, offering insights for decision-making.
Of course, here's the summary with the pronoun "I" instead of "you":

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - I start with basic exploratory queries such as selecting all data from the table and finding the maximum total laid-off count and maximum percentage laid-off.
   - Further, I explore specific subsets of data, such as companies with the highest percentage of layoffs and companies with the highest total layoffs.

2. **Analysis by Company**:
   - I analyze layoffs by individual companies, both in terms of total layoffs and the highest total layoffs per company.

3. **Analysis Over Time**:
   - I examine layoffs over time, looking at trends by year and month, and calculating rolling totals to observe cumulative layoffs.

4. **Analysis by Industry and Country**:
   - I analyze layoffs by industry and country to identify trends and patterns.

5. **Ranking Analysis**:
   - Finally, I perform ranking analysis to identify top companies with the highest layoffs per year.
